        <h1>Localizing ChatZilla</h1>
        <p>
            This page explains the process for localizing ChatZilla but does not go into depth on more general issues, such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/mercurial">using Mercurial</a> or <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/SeaMonkey:Localization">localizing SeaMonkey</a>. You will need <strong>basic command-line skills</strong>. If you have any questions or issues localizing ChatZilla, or just want to chat with fellow users and developers, feel free to drop by in <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/chatzilla">#chatzilla on moznet</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><var>ab-CD</var></dt><dd>This text is used to refer to the locale code for your localization. You should replace every occurance with your localization's correct code. For example, French would likely use '<samp>fr-FR</samp>'.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> is required for all localizations.</li>
            <li><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> may be used to easily keep up-to-date with new changes in ChatZilla, but is not required.</li>
            <li>Optionally update the Mozilla <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Teams">Localization Teams</a> so people know who's working on what.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>1. Get the source code</h2>
        <h3>With Mercurial</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a terminal or Command Prompt.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the folder you want to store the code using the <kbd>cd</kbd> command.</li>
            <li>Run the command "<kbd>hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/chatzilla</kbd>" - this will take a short while.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Without Mercurial</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/chatzilla/archive/tip.zip">ZIP archive</a>.</li>
            <li>Extract the files into the folder you want to store the code.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>2. Make locale directory</h2>
        <p>
            To get started on your localization, copy the <samp>locales/en-US</samp> directory to <samp>locales/<var>ab-CD</var></samp>. Remember that <var>ab-CD</var> should be named after the language code of the locale you're writing a localization for.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Localize files</h2>
        <p>
            You need to localize the following files:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><samp>locales/<var>ab-CD</var>/chrome/chatzilla.properties</samp></li>
            <li><samp>locales/<var>ab-CD</var>/chrome/*.dtd</samp></li>
            <li><samp>locales/<var>ab-CD</var>/defines.inc</samp></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While you are localizing these files, please remember:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Do</strong> open and save all files as UTF-8 without BOM.</li>
            <li><strong>Do</strong> localize entries of the form <samp>cmd.<em>something</em>.help</samp> as these are the command descriptions shown to the user.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> localize entries of the form <samp>cmd.<em>something</em>.params</samp> as these are the parameters for commands, which need to match up to the code.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> change <samp>locale.version</samp> as this is necessary to detect mismatched language packs. There are further details of this requirement in comments at the begginning of <samp>chatzilla.properties</samp>.</li>
            <li><strong>Do</strong> keep up with new versions of ChatZilla, if you can. The <a href="https://james-ross.co.uk/mozilla/chatzilla/nightly/">ChatZilla nightly builds</a> page may be helpful, as it lists which files have changed - search for "<kbd>locales/en-US</kbd>" to find all potentially relevant changes. You are welcome to linger in <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/chatzilla">#chatzilla</a> as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Do</strong> keep archives/copies of localization releases you have made, in case you need to refer back to them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. Make locale package</h2>
        <p>
            You can create a locale package at any time to check how things are coming along, or when you're done. Please note that this will <strong>overwrite</strong> a locale package of the same language and version.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a terminal or Command Prompt.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <samp>xpi</samp> folder inside the ChatZilla code using the <kbd>cd</kbd> command.</li>
            <li>Run the command "<kbd>python makexpi.py <var>ab-CD</var></kbd>".</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If all goes well, a <samp>xpi/chatzilla-<var>ab-CD</var>-<var>version</var>.xpi</samp> file will be created. This file installs <strong>only</strong> your localization - that means users will have to install ChatZilla separately. It can also be used by SeaMonkey users to localize their preinstalled ChatZilla.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Test your localization</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the host application (Firefox, SeaMonkey, etc.), open the <samp>xpi/chatzilla-<var>ab-CD</var>-<var>version</var>.xpi</samp> file, e.g. from the menu "<kbd>File > Open File...</kbd>".</li>
            <li>Restart the host application and open ChatZilla.</li>
            <li>Check that all strings fit in the space that they are given.</li>
            <li>Check that all <samp>%S</samp> replacements are working correctly.</li>
            <li>Check that each accesskey is used only once in each menu.</li>
            <li>...and all the usual localization checks.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>6. Distributing your localization</h2>
        <p>
            When you think you have fixed all possible bugs in your localization, you might want to consider releasing it to the public.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You could ask an admin of a local Mozilla community site to upload your language pack to their server.</li>
            <li>You could upload it to the official <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Add-ons site</a>.</li>
            <li>You can ask in <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/chatzilla">#chatzilla</a> to have a link added to the official homepage. You can also do this by <a href="https://github.com/twpol/cz-homepage/blob/master/index.html">creating a pull request for the homepage in GitHub</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Appendix: Bundling your localization with SeaMonkey</h2>
        <p>
            It is possible to ship your ChatZilla localization with <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/">SeaMonkey</a> for an even more complete Internet experience. Just follow these steps.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Get a copy of the l10n repository for your locale</h3>
        <p>
            Installing Mercurial was optional in the previous section, but here it's mandatory. After installing it, open a terminal, navigate to a directory where you want to save the l10n repository, and execute the following command:<br>
            <br>
            <kbd>hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-aurora/ab-CD</kbd><br>
            <br>
            Note that some locales might not have the -CD part here.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Make a Mercurial patch containing your localization work</h3>
        <p>
            Copy the <tt>ab-CD</tt> subdirectory from the <tt>locales</tt> directory in the <tt>chatzilla</tt> repository to the <tt>extensions</tt> directory in the l10n repository (you'll need to create the <tt>extensions</tt> directory if it doesn't exist) and rename the new copy from 'ab-CD' to 'irc'. After doing so, open a terminal, navigate to the l10n repository and execute the following command:<br>
            <br>
            <kbd>hg diff > /%S/chatzilla-locale.patch</kbd><br>
            <br>
            where %S is the path to your desktop. This will create a file that, in Mercurial terminology, is called a "patch".
        </p>
        <h3>3. Create a bug to get the patch into Mercurial</h3>
        <p>
            Create yourself an account on <a target="_blank" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Mozilla's Bugzilla</a>, then <a target="_blank" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mozilla%20Localizations">file a bug</a>.
            <ul>
            <li>Choose your locale from the 'Component' menu.
            <li>In the 'Description' field, ask someone who has Mercurial access to upload the patch to Mercurial.
            <li>Attach the patch file by pressing the 'Add an attachment' button.
            </ul>
            Finally, press the 'Submit Bug' button. You will receive an email notification when someone has uploaded the patch.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Create a bug to get your locale built</h3>
        <p>
            Wait for someone to upload the patch to Mercurial, then <a target="_blank" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=SeaMonkey&amp;component=Build%20Config&amp;version=Trunk">file another bug</a>.
            <ul>
            <li>In the 'Summary' field, type "Add ab-CD to ChatZilla all-locales".
            <li>This time you can leave the 'Description' field empty.
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>5. Download SeaMonkey with ChatZilla</h3>
        <p>
            Once your locale has been added to all-locales, you could either try a nightly build, or wait for an official release.
